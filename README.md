# PhoenixPlayground

Simple tutorial on using LiveVive with LLMs through API call that is HTTP streamed.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Make sure you have running postgres.

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000/home`](http://localhost:4000/home) from your browser.
